    <p> In this assignmnet, we learned about markdown and html. In this assignmnet we learned how to add images and use markdown. The scenario was that we met our friend from school after 5 years and we have a little time to catch up. 
        We had to pick 4 categories for your goals. Mine were Family, Hobbies, Travel and University. We were given four markdown sheets where we put your categories as headings and talk about the important things that you have accomplished and want to tell it to your classmate. 
        Add a picture realted to each category and use it in the markdown.

        Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. It allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
        In the first markdown file I talked about family, how I spent time with my grandparents and made some really nice memories. I also got more close with my parents as I had more time to spent with them. Also talked about my brother who got married and how much fun I had planning his wedding. 
        Then I talked about my hobbies that is watching anime and reading books. Also I talked about the collection of all the kpop albums I wanted.  
        I love traveling and my dream place to visit was greece which I visited last year. Then the most important my carrer, I told about my job asa UX designer and how I would love to learn more and grow in this feild. This assignmnet made me think about my future goals and made me wonder how I would be after 5 years rom now. We also got to learn a lot about html like adding images and formatting the margins.

  <div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-grey w3-padding-3" id="about">
    <p> In the previous assignment we set goals 5 years in to the future. In this assignment we looked back in time.
       We had to consider anything that we were involved with that required consistent effort and contribution of some kind. 
        We could consider jobs that we have held, volunteer work, a new language or musical instrument we learnt. Through this assignment we are just trying to discover the path we are already on and how it supports our goals.

        This assignmnet was about formatting with CSS we used different CSS stylesheets to make our website more appealing.
         To me this assignmnet was definitely more interesting than assignment 1, I talked about my experiences in the past. 
         The first one i talked about was volunteer work I did at a gurudwara when I was in highschool, I used to teach Punjabi to kids there. 
         I really loved doing it as I would also learn more things about my culture. The second experience we talked about was Learning Piano.  
         I started learning when I was a 10 years old and I made some good friends in the class, some of them are still my friends. When I was in middleschool in India I used to 
         teach my house helpers son in India. I felt happy about helping him as he genuinely wanted to learn and be something. My favourite thing about my school in india is the Community Outreach program 
        where we used to go to orphanages and old age homes to donate them stuff they need. Just helping people and making them happy made me happy too. 
        The last experience I talked about was joining the Badminton team when I was in high school. I still love playing Badminton and all the good memories about it.
        From this assignmnet we learnt how choose 2 complimentary fonts from google fonts and incorporate them in your css, 1 for headings and 1 for body text
        We had to choose at least 3 complimentary and sufficiently contrasting color foregrounds and backgrounds to use for your navbar and footer and buttons and put them in the root element of your css file.
        We also learnt how to color the nav and also color the footer. Overall this assignmnet was really helpful with making the portfolio.
