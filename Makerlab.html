    I took the responsibility of auditing the components to designing them as a library that consists of reusable and customizable components which are used by the designers in the team to create meaningful interactions and interfaces. I worked with the engineers, senior interaction designers, a visual design lead to deploy the project.
    
    Unfortunately, due to NDA I am unable to share any specific details about the project. If you have questions about my experience, feel free to drop an email.

    The design system was treated on par with a product by defining a similar process that helps in continuously maintaining it and building over it. I could not disclose the detailed comprehensive process due to the NDA, but the brief version of the process followed is as shown below.

    <li>1. Performed an audit of the components across the product to design and implement it in the library.</li>
    <li>2. Designed and shipped the first version of the library of components for the product.</li>
    <li>3. Componentized the major elements of the product to ship it to interaction designers as a library which improved the productivity of designers.</li>
    <li>4. The design system helped in improving the consistency and performance of the product.</li>
    5. Conducted education and testing sessions for the designers to use the design system.
