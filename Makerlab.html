    <p> When designing and creating different projects sometimes picking out colours and looking for inspiration is difficult but the colour box aids helping us better visualize the colour. Rather than picking and choosing different colours in the design to see what works well with one another you will be able to interact with the physical colours to pick and choose the colour you decide. You can change out different colours to figure out which work well together. This concept was created based off of the online version of colour schemes. Making the online version physical allows you to see an assortment of different colours rather than just a select few at a time. Seeing things in person allows designers to visualize what it will look like once it is finished.

      When thinking about designing and making the prototype we were just going to put paper as shades but that didn't work as it was not sustainable and not visible from the top so we decided to use cardboard. For me the biggest challenge was to make the colours print in perfect size that is 8.5 X 6.5 so it would be all the same size. When we started to make a prototype we had two designs in mind, It took some tinkering with this approach to realize which method would be most effective.

    <p>PROTOTYPE PRODUCTION METHOD DETAILS<br>
      Materials needed:<br>
      - Cardboard Box (10 in x 12 in x 7 in)<br>
      - Smaller Boxes Inside<br>
      - Variety of Different Colours <br>
      - Removable Colour Swatches<br>
      - Customizable <br>

  <img src="colourboxdrawing.png" alt="colourbox" class="w3-image" width="350" height="400">
      <br><br> Steps: <br>
1. For making the colour box first we found the most used colours and printed them in the size 8.5 X 6.5. <br>
2. Then we cut a thin cardboard into 5.5 X 7.5 cm and cover the cardboard with the coloured paper we printed.<br>
3. We use a big cardboard box and add the pieces inside in different colour groups<br>
This was time consuming but worked perfectly with the idea we had in mind. In the end we had 133 different colours to allow users to have a variety of different colours to choose from which could be removed and moved around depending on your design choices.

      After presenting our prototype we discussed our current design limitations. Firstly, the prototype we made is not of the best quality, it is not durable enough. If in the future we have to make a better prototype we will not use print paper and paste on cardboards. Also the design right now contains limited colours, we would add more colours in future. We would make the box more efficient and easy to carry around while traveling by adding a handle and using a box made with bioplastics. Overall, we would like to make our prototype better in the future and also incorporate new ideas.

        <p> When thinking of designing something that demonstrates the concept of “critical making” and making something that is accessible and also addresses a social issue, me and my group members decided to make a Keyboard guard. Keyboards can be extremely challenging for certain persons with impairments to use in a variety of scenarios. There is typically an irregularity between the digital world and the disabled community. Accessible keyboards are incredible methods for adjusting that gap. We want to serve as many different types of people as we can with our accessible keyboard by providing keyboard covers. We made three distinct keyboard customization options available: one with braille, one with just the guard, and one with the opportunity to alter the key colour. 
<br><br>The covers are easily interchangeable for convenience. The keyboard protector is simple to carry and attach to the keyboard when we have to use a computer somewhere else, like a library. In this manner, we may still use the keyboard as if it were your own at home. We can pack up the guard and head out when we're ready to leave. When consumers require help, we want to make sure it is simple, secure, and dependable.

          While making the prototype, we ran into some issues. We were going to make a cardboard keyboard guard, but we dropped that idea as it would be hard to carry around and also was breakable and flimsy. Instead, we found that hot glue would be easier to work with. This way we can get between each key on the keyboard without overlapping on other keys. Also to secure the guard we were thinking of using rubber bands but we didn't as it might break overtime and would be time consuming to put on. So we decided to use ziptags as they are more durable and efficient.

Materials:<br>
- Hot Glue<br>
- Zip Ties<br>
- Tiny Gems<br>
- Clear wrap<br>
- Cardboard<br>
- Sticker Paper<br>
Steps:<br>
- First we used a clear wrap and covered the keyboard with it.<br>
- Then we used the hot glue gun to trace the keys and waited till it dried.<br>
- We repeated the process, but this time we added tiny diamonds for each letter in braille.<br>
- In order for customers to change the colour for each key of their choice, we added the colour customization feature that offers 
  stickers with each colour.<br>

          After presenting our prototype we discussed our current design limitations. Firstly, the prototype we made is not of the best quality, it is not durable enough. Our main design that we would like to make in the future would use 3D printing so that it is more accurate. Also the design we made for now is only for a specific type of keyboard, we would incorporate more styles and colours in the future. As we mentioned before we used zip tags to secure the guard which is not the best option as people might want it to be quick, we can add clip ons on the edges of the guard, that will make it more efficient. Overall, we would like to make our prototype better in the future and also incorporate new types of guards to be more accessible.
